                <p>I worked with Tom at whilst at Boeing, he was a great colleague and a pleasure to work with. Tom has a great attitude towards tough and complex tasks and is great within a team or when left to work alone. Tom has exceptional skills at presenting back findings via presentations and written communication. Tom is able to think outside the box to complete tasks, often refining processes at the same time.</p>

                <p>Tom worked for me providing research and data management support to business development activities. He gained a considerable experience working at Boeing while contributing a significant amount to a number of opportunities. Bright, intelligent and very personable. I'd happily recommend Tom to any employer.</p>

                <p>Tom worked to identify key decision makers and develop marketing strategies for promoting our new products and services. During the project Tom collected important market intelligence where he analysed and reported strategic recommendations to the board. Tom managed his own time to meet key milestones and targets. Tom's ability to learn quickly, personable nature and drive to meet objectives is a great asset to have on any team. I highly recommend Tom.</p>
